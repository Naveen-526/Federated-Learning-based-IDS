## Introduction

As IoT devices proliferate, the need for robust security measures becomes critical. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to scale and adapt to the dynamic nature of edge networks. FL-IDS addresses these challenges by leveraging federated learning, allowing devices to learn from local data without sharing sensitive information.

## Features

- **Decentralized Learning**: Each device learns from its own data, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Anomaly Detection**: The system can identify unusual patterns in network traffic, alerting administrators to potential threats.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Sensitive data remains on the device, ensuring user privacy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily integrates with various edge devices and IoT networks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of network traffic for immediate threat detection.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to ensure efficiency and security:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Facilitates communication between edge devices and the central server.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes advanced algorithms for analyzing network traffic.
- **Federated Learning**: Implements federated learning principles to enhance model training.
- **Flower Framework**: A robust framework for federated learning.
- **LeNet-5**: A convolutional neural network model used for anomaly detection.
- **IoT Device Integration**: Supports various sensors and IoT devices.
- **SSL Certificates**: Ensures secure communication between devices.
- **TensorFlow**: A powerful library for building and training machine learning models.

## Installation

To set up the FL-IDS on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naveen-526/Federated-Learning-based-IDS.git
   cd Federated-Learning-based-IDS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up SSL Certificates**:
   For secure communication, generate SSL certificates. Follow the instructions in the `docs/SSL_Setup.md` file.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the server and client applications:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   python client.py
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the monitoring dashboard.

## Usage

After setting up the FL-IDS, you can use it to monitor your IoT network. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Configure Devices**: Ensure all IoT devices are configured to communicate with the server.
2. **Monitor Traffic**: The dashboard will display real-time network traffic and alerts for any detected anomalies.
3. **Review Logs**: Access logs to analyze past incidents and improve security measures.
